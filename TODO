process source code blocks with tree sitter https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tree-sitter

Check to see if pandoc html output can be changed somehow (for header anchor links)
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-3.5/docs/Text-Pandoc-Writers.html#t:Writer
HXT on the generated html is an option
https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#custom-readers-and-writers might be an option https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html
most likely will be a generic lua filter though https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html



see if performance can be improved (it isn't slow atm but it definitely feels like there's a bottleneck)
